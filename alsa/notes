[ future implementation ]

the futur implement will assume 2 DMA(one for write, one for read). the
main loop always start the 2 transfer first. then filter_apply gets called.
at the end of the iteration, check for DMA transfers done OR deadline elapsed. 


[ fixme ]

dev_{write,read}_all: implement function that io all samples and fail
if requested timeout elapses

how to start an asynchronous read / write transfer and test for completion.
This should be the role of nonblocking mode, but currently used to block
